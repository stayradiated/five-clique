# five-clique.go

A port of Benjammin Passen's [five_clique](https://gitlab.com/bpaassen/five_clique) word search solution written in go.

Uses [the deduplicated word graph idea from Jelle Martijn
Koko](https://gitlab.com/bpaassen/five_clique/-/merge_requests/1).

## Description

> This solution is inspired by the wonderful [A problem squared
> podcast](https://aproblemsquared.libsyn.com/) by Hill and Parker. In episode
> 38, Hill and Parker are searching for five English words with distinct letters.
> Parker's proposed solution builds pairs of distinct words and then tries to
> merge these pairs to groups of five (henceforth named 'The Parker algorithm').
> According to Parker, executing the Parker algorithm on a laptop took about a
> month. This appeared to the author as optimizable.
> 
> The solution proposed here represents the problem as a graph. In particular, we
> consider all 5-letter words (without repeated letters) of the English language
> as nodes in a graph, and we say that two words are neighbors if they share no
> letters. Finding 5 words with distinct letters now is equivalent to finding a
> [5-clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)) in this graph,
> meaning a cluster of 5 words where each word is neighbor to each other word in
> the cluster.
> 
> How do we find a 5-clique, then? We start at some word i and build a clique
> from there. First, we consider all neighbors j. The third word k in the clique
> now needs to be neighbor to both i and j. Therefore, we consider only words k
> in the intersection of the neighbor sets of i and j. Next, we consider words l
> in the intersection of the neighbor sets of i, j, and k. Finally, any words r
> in the intersection of the neighbor sets of i, j, k, and l form a 5-clique {i,
> j, k, l, r}. To avoid repitions, we only consider solutions where i < j < k < l
> < r.
> 
> In the worst case, this scheme has a complexity of O(n^5), where n is the
> number of 5-letter words in the English language. This may seem infeasible.
> However, the size of the intersection rapidly declines the deeper we go into
> the clique. Therefore, we are finished in 21 minutes and 46 seconds, rather
> than a month, as in the Parker algorithm.
> 
> But Parker gave it a go. And that's something.

## Quickstart guide

To reproduce my calculation, please execute the following steps:

1. Download the `words_alpha.txt` file from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (this is the same file that Parker used).
2. Build this project with `go build`
2. Run `./five-clique generate` file. (should take around 20 seconds)
3. Run `./five-clique search` file. (should take at most a few hours)

All five-word groups with distinct letters should then be in the file `cliques.csv`.
